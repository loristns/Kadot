# Natural language processing using unsupervised vectors representation.

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/kadot/badge/?version=1.0dev)](http://kadot.readthedocs.io/en/1.0dev/?badge=1.0dev) [![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/513eab88b0af4c93b1524d91090397a0)](https://www.codacy.com/app/lorisazerty/Kadot?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=the-new-sky/Kadot&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

*⚠️ You are reading the README about Kadot 1.0 which is under development.*
*⚠️ Kadot is no longer in development, the project had two branches: [0.x](https://github.com/the-new-sky/Kadot/tree/master) and 1.x (this one).*

**Kadot** is a high-level open-source library to easily process text documents. It relies on vector representations of documents or words in order to solve NLP tasks such as **summarization**, **spellchecking** or **classification**.

```python
# How to get n-grams using kadot.
>>> from kadot.tokenizers import regex_tokenizer
>>> hello_tokens = regex_tokenizer("Kadot just lets you process a text easily.")
>>> hello_tokens.ngrams(n=2)

[('Kadot', 'just'), ('just', 'lets'), ('lets', 'you'), ('you', 'process'), ('process', 'a'), ('a', 'text'), ('text', 'easily')]
```
## What's 🆕 in 1.0 ?
*⚠️ All these new features may not yet be available on Github.*

- **Vectorizers** : We are now offering Word2Vec, the state-of-the-art Fasttext and Doc2Vec algorithms using [Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/)'s powerful backend.
- **Performances** : Using a much more efficient algorithm, the new word vectorizer is up to 95% faster and sparse vectors now take up to 94% less memory.
- **Models** : Kadot now includes a *text classifier*, an *automatic text summarizer* and an *entity labeler* which can be useful in many projects.
- **Bot Engine** : **Soon**
- **Dependencies** 😞 : In order to guarantee good performance without reinventing the wheel, we are adding [Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) and [Pytorch](http://pytorch.org/) to our list of dependencies. Although installed by default, these libraries will be optional and only Numpy and Scipy are strictly required to use Kadot.
